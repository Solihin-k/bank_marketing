    "\n",
    "The bank recently experienced a decline in the number of subcriptions for their [term deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termdeposit.asp). They have come up with ads for their existing clients to address this and would like to do a targeted marketing approach. They would like to predict which of their clients have a higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit."
