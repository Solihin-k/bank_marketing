# Bank Marketing Strategy
An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on bank marketing campaign for a term deposit.

## Description
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).

### The Problem
The bank recently experienced a decline in the number of subcriptions for their [term deposit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termdeposit.asp). They have come up with ads for their existing clients to address this and would like to do a targeted marketing approach. They would like to predict which of their clients have a higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit.

### The Objective
- To understand what factors contributed most to term deposit subscription.

- To perform clustering to find any meaningful patterns of employee traits.

- To create a model that predicts the likelihood if a certain client will subscribe for a term deposit or not. 

- To create or improve different marketing strategies for clients that are least likely to subscribe for a term deposit.

The implementation of this model will allow the bank to create better marketing strategies.
